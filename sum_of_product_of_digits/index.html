      /*
            You have 2 numbers say n1: 6, n2:34

            You need to multiply corresponding digits and add them

                        6
            3           4
            (3*0)   +   (6*4)
            0       +   24

            n1: 123
            n2: 45
            1           2           3
                        4           5
            (1*0)   +   (2*4)   +   (3*5)
            0       +   8       +   15
            23

            n1: 123
            n2: 45

            Approach 1:
            (Keep on getting last digits of the numbers, update sum, stop if any number reaches 0)
            Iteration 1:
            n1%10 = 3
            n2%10 = 5
            3*5 add it to sum
            n1 -> n1/10 = 12
            n2 -> n2/10 = 4

            Iteration 2:
            n1%10 = 2
            n2%10 = 4
            2*4 add it to sum
            n1 -> n1/10 = 1
            n2 -> n2/10 = 0

            Iteration 3:
            WILL NOT HAPPEN
            condition is: while(n1 > 0 && n2 > 0) 0 > 0 false (for n2)

            n1:           123
            n2:     123456789


            Approach 2:
            (convert both numbers to string. Get last same length substring. Iterate char by char, multiply, add to sum)

            n1:           123
            n2:     123456789

            n1: "123456789"
            n2: "123"
            diff = Math.abs(n1.length - n2.length)

            s1 = n1.substr(n1.length-diff) = "123"
            s2 = n2.substr(diff) = "789"

            Now iterate over them char by char, multiply and add
            '1'*'7' + '2'*'8' + '3'*'9'
            Before multiplying convert back to integer

            Approach 3:
            n1: "123456789"
            n2: "123"
            min = Math.min(n1.length, n2.length)

            s1 = n1.substr(n1.length-min) = "123"
            s2 = n2.substr(n2.length-min) = "789"

            Now iterate over them char by char, multiply and add
            '1'*'7' + '2'*'8' + '3'*'9'
            Before multiplying convert back to integer

            Approach 4:
            n1: "123456789"
            n2: "123"

            n1: "987654321"
            n2: "321"
            min = 3
            n1[0]*n2[0] + n1[1]*n2[1] + n1[2]*n2[2]

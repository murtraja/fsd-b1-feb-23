        1. Browsers - Front end development
            - making websites
        2. Backend - Node server / any web server

        // Flow for the game
        1. Computer generates / stores the secret number
            a. Number is between 1 and 10
        2. Computer asks the user to guess the number
        3. User enters the number and computer stores it in variable - guessedNumber
        4. Computer matches the entered number with the stored secret number

          -> Objects
          -> code modularity
        5. Instead of showing "Try again", display helpful message like your guess was below or above the secretNumber

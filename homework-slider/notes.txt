1. Create an animated click toggle switch or a slider as given in the reference image
2. The slider should be responsive
3. The width of the slider = width of the container
4. When changing the size, make sure that the height changes proportionally
    - example if width is 300, then height is 200
    - if width is 600, then height is 400
    - small difference in these values is allowed as long as it is not noticeable
5. NO JAVASCRIPT
6. NO MEDIA QUERY

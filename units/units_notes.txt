Different units in CSS and when to use them?

List of units:
1. pixels (px)
2. vw
3. vh
4. %
5. rem
6. em
7. cm
8. in
9. fr (grid later)

avoid using px as much as possible
    - it fixes the size
    - difficult to scale / make responsive
    - border: 1px solid red;
    - rarely in padding: 16px
    - rarely in images / media

generally we use rem and em
    - text related sizes
        font-size
    - container sizing
    - padding
    - margin
    - em's size will depend on the parent's font-size
    - good for scaling and making things responsive
    - rem: relative to root element
        so easier to calculate the final value
    - 1em -> 16px, 1em -> 32px, 1.7 -> ??

for responsiveness use %
    - if content to appear same irrespective of screen size, then use %

vw, vh
    - generally used for fixed positioned elements
    - 2vw => 2 % of the viewport width
    - 200vw => 2 times the viewport width

in, cm, mm
    - typesetting and printing media
    - create a receipt for a payment
